         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And howſoeuer it be true, that through the goodnes of God, we haue many other helps which (by our cooperating with his grace) may induce vs much towards the remayning in our duty, or at least returning towards him; as namely the counſaile of vertuous friends, the reading of holy bookes, and the obſeruation of Gods vniuerſall prouidence; yet I thinke there is none which doth more ſweetly inſinuate it ſelfe, and more effectually preuaile with vs, then that of good and fit examples. <hi>Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niùs irritant animum demiſſa per aures, quàm quae ſunt oculis ſubiecta fidelibus:</hi> The hearing of good aduiſe is but a dull kind

<pb facs="tcp:1661:9"/>
whome I haue already deſcribed. In whoſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of them, if there be a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is in that he may be thought a little ſcrupulous, through the great light he hath of the purity &amp; Maieſty of almighty God, on the one ſide, and the great indecency or rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which he diſcouereth in the leaſt ſinne on the other. Now the paſſages of this Saints life, after ſhe entred into the Monaſtery were verifyed, and that vpon Oath, by theſe other Religious women that liued with her, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of their ſpirituall Magiſtrats, who had authority to take full information thereof.</p>
            <p>Let me further preſent to your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, diſcreet Reader, that at the tyme of taking thoſe Oaths, the Religious were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulerly put in mind (though they were far from being ignorant therof before) of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an oath, and with how much truth &amp; reuerence they were bound to ſweare; &amp; that they muſt not, for the conuerting, or ſauing of the whole world, tell the leaſt officious lye, &amp; eſpecially in matters of this nature; wherin as it was to be an act of Iustice, and Religion, to expreſſe a truth when they were lawfully called thereunto: ſo to publiſh, and authorize an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth,
<pb facs="tcp:1661:10"/>
truth, was to commit a grieuous ſinne. And indeed the Catholique, Apoſtolique, Roman Church doth ſo much abhorre all colluſion, &amp; fraud in this high kind, as that it denounceth a ſolemne ſentence of moſt rigorous Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> to be incurred, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſhall publiſh, or any way cooperate wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly towards a falſe Miracle.</p>
            <p>Now therfore that ſuch a company of holy women, as I haue heere deſcribed, who do otherwiſe lead a life of ſo great perfection, and pennance, as is notorious to the world in thoſe parts, being directed in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience by ſuch a Ghoſtly Father, &amp; being put in mind of their duty towards God, and the world, in ſo expreſſe manner, by their other ſpirituall Gouernours, ſhould in deſpite of all Religion, and reaſon, combine, and band themſelues to deceaue the world, and damne their owne ſoules, by auow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſolemne vntruths; and to do all this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene foure walls, and in the middeſt of perpetuall faſtings, praying, haire cloath, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplines, and the like, is not only improbable, but impoſsible. And I ſhall wonder with what ſenſe, by the Ciuill, or Municipall Law of any Countrey, the oaths of any two honeſt men, or
<pb facs="tcp:1661:10"/>
women, may be admitted to rule the caſe of mens lands, and liues, and that the oaths of ſo many perſons, and ſuch perſons, ſhould be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in verifying of that which paſſed vpon their knowledge, and vnder their eyes. So that when this truth is tould you, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Chapters of this following hiſtory, were ratifyed by the ſubſcription, and oaths of theſe Religious, I aſſure my ſelfe that all danger of doubt will be remoued; and to the end that there be no question made, but that they did ſo ſubſcribe, &amp; ſweare, I will heer ſet down that part of the Authors Preface to the Reader which concerneth the act in law, wherby it is expreſly declared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the end, that the truth of what is deliuered in this hiſtory, might appear more clearely, the moſt Reuerend</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſig<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Pietro Nicolini, <hi>Vicar-Generall of</hi> Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>at the inſtance of the Gouernour of the Monaſtery, came in perſon to the ſame place, togeather with the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the</hi> Archbiſhoprike, <hi>vpon the 14. day of April, in the yeare of our Lord 1609. where, calling all the Religious of that Houſe into their preſence, who had
<pb facs="tcp:1661:11"/>
ſeen with their owne eyes the actions of their Mother</hi> Suor Maria Maddalena, <hi>which are ſet down in this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t work, he examined them moſt particulerly, concerning the truth therof. Which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious women, amounting to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of threeſcore, who are accuſtomed euery morning to receaue the Body of our Lord, did affirme, vnder their oaths, that thoſe thinges which are recounted in this life of this ſeruant of God, are meere, and reall Truth; and many of them, did moreouer ſay by word of mouth, that they had ſeene many more particulers, then are written there. Now therefore at the end of euery Chapter of this booke thoſe Religious women who were preſent, and ſaw the wonderfull things which therein are ſeuerally rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did ſubſcribe the ſame with their owne hand writing; and ſo by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of all theſe Chapters, there is a great booke filled; and in the preſence of Monſig<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. the Vicar Generall, and of the Gouernour of the Monaſtery, and of foure witneſſes, there was an authentical
<pb facs="tcp:1661:11"/>
Inſtrument, or Writing, made by Sig<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.</hi> Froſino, <hi>a</hi> Milaneſe, <hi>Chancellour of the Archbiſhoprike, which publique Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or writing, togeather with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayd booke, full of ſubſcriptions is kept for eternall memory in the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; and a coppy of them both (being authenticated by the ſayd Chancellour) was entred, &amp; is conſerued in the Roles of the Archbiſhopricke of</hi> Florence. <hi>And all this diligence was vſed, to take from any man (that ſhall read the great and wonderfull thinges that God did worke by this Mother</hi> Suor Maria Maddalena, <hi>his beloued Spouſe) the leaſt ſuſpition, or doubt, of the truth therof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is contayned in the Authours Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Reader, touching thoſe thinges that paſſed from the tyme of her entring into the Monaſtery, which was in the ſeauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenth yeare of her age, vntill the tyme of her death, which happened in the one and fortith yeare: and for thoſe other that are recounted from her firſt vſe of reaſon, till ſhe entred into Religion, her Mother, and Seruants, &amp; next kindred, and Ghostly Fathers did certainly, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:1661:12"/>
ionytly, and ſeuerally auow, that which is heer related, beſides that her ſelfe did confeſſe them to be true. So that for as much as concernes the matter in fact, the credit of the history be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ſettled, as I conceaue it is; I will only in a few words giue an aduice, or two, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reading of this life, whether it fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And firſt let it be layd for a ground, that <hi>mirabilis eſt Deus in Sanctis ſuis,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God is wonderfull in his Saints. God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So alſo are his Saints (in whom nature is not deſtroyed, but perfected) conducted by the hand of his admirable prouidence in ſeueral wayes: ſome by Comforts, and Rapts &amp; Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies of loue and they alſo are in themſelues of very ſeuerall kinds; for ſome of them bind all the ſenſes at once, and ſome leaue them free to ſome particuler purpoſes; euen as we ſee, that naturally it happeneth ſometyms in dreames. And in like manner we alſo find by experience, that ſome men are mad outright, and others againe are ſo in ſome one particuler occaſion,

            <p>But it pleaſeth God to lead on other Saints by great aridityes, and deſolations of ſpirit: and ſo he maketh them appeare in the eyes of men to be no more then ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; &amp; others againe he placeth as Lanternes and Beakons, for all the world to behould<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and take example by, through the ſupernaturall concourſe which it pleaſeth his diuine Maiesty to yield of working many, and most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted miracles in confirmation of their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or otherwiſe for the manifestation of his owne greater glory, as it hath been abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene in the caſe of <hi>Suor Maria Maddale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> The euidence of whoſe holynes, and the teſtimony which it both pleaſed God to giue vnto it, hath ſo appeared in the eyes of the world, as that order is come from <hi>Rome</hi> to the Religious where ſhe liued, that they may publiquely expoſe her Picture in their Church, with the <hi>Voto's</hi> round about it, which are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonyes of the graces that God hath granted by means of her interceſſion.

after a most rigorous examination of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers (which is taken by a Congregation of Cardinalls, and other learned and prudent, pious men deputed euer for theſe purpoſes) as that euen this circumstance alone, doth much aduance our certainty of her ſanctity, and this ſo much the more becauſe it hath beene done within a dozen yeares after her death. A rare example: for the Church walkes on with a foot of lead in ſuch occaſions as theſe, and maks not ſuch hast, but vpon extraordinary induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>And whenſoeuer any particuler is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted, if a man ſhall deride it, becauſe only it is ſtrang, or ſuperiour to the courſe of nature, or becauſe it is ridiculous in his opinion, and contrary to thoſe fooliſh, and falſe grounds which ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s diſcourſe being naturally both lame and blind, hath framed for it ſelfe to walke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, he may alſo ſcoffe at thoſe particulers which are related in the holy Scripture it ſelfe, <hi>That God condemned all mankind, for one only mans, and womans eating of an apple: That he brought armyes of frogs into Pharo's Court, in deſpite of al his guardes: That the wedge of the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet
<pb facs="tcp:1661:14"/>
leaped inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly vp to the helme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was put into the water: That the ſight of a man borne blind, was giuen by meanes of applying durt, and ſpittle to his eyes: That ſicke perſons were cured by walking only in another mans ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.</hi> Theſe thinges, and many other like to theſe, are recorded in holy Scripture, and yet no Chriſtian man muſt preſume ſo much as once to doubt therof. So as the only strangnes or ſupernaturallnes of any euent, cannot au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize any modeſt, and wiſe perſon to deride it; but may iustly &amp; ought in prudence oblige him to doubt thereof, or rather to deny his aſſent therto till it be conueniently proued.</p>
            <p>The authority therefore is that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the credit of any ſupernaturall thing doth depend, whether it be more, or leſſe, and not only the meere ſtrangnes of the thing it ſelfe. And from hence it is, that whatſoeuer is recorded in holy Scripture, how wide ſoeuer it falleth in reſpect of our experience, or how far ſoeuer it ouerſhooteth in reſpect of reaſon, muſt cheerefully, &amp; vndoubtedly be aſſented to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it resteth vpon an infallible authority, which is the Reuelation of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb facs="tcp:1661:15"/>
of his Catholike Church. And ſuch an authority doth declare whatſoeuer thing to be as certainly true, as truth it ſelfe is true; and that no man may doubt thereof, but vpon the price of being either an Infidell or an Heretike. There is another kind of inferiour authority, ſtanding vpon humane, and morall proofe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited vnder the Oaths of many perſons, being eye witneſſes, and free from all exception, both concerning the very actions themſelues of Saints, and the miraculous works of God ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in honour of them, &amp; by the meanes of their interceſsion, whereof no man, that hath perfect information of the particulers, can ſo much as doubt without extreme imprudence, nor once deride without profaneneſſe.</p>
            <p>But he that deſerues to weare that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, will not only laugh at me, tranſlating heere the life of this moderne Saint; but will make as little ſcruple to laugh at all our Saints Liues, though written by other Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and other moſt excellent perſons, as <hi>S. Bonauenture</hi> writing the life of <hi>S. Francis, S. Bernard</hi> of <hi>S. Malachias, Paulus Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conus</hi> of <hi>S. Gregory, S. Gregory</hi> of <hi>S.

Doctour, <hi>S. Hierome</hi> of <hi>S. Paul</hi> the firſt Eremit, of <hi>S.

Athanaſius</hi> of <hi>S. Anthony,</hi> who all relate miraculous things of thoſe ſeuerall Saints in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. As little difficulty, I ſay, will he make to laugh at theſe, which I heere relate in the perſon of my Authour, whilest yet whoſoeuer he be, he cannot bring the tenth part of that proofe, whereby he would be taken for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sonne, or the heyre of his Fathers land, or that the very name he is knowne by, is his owne; which I will offer to the eye of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different man, for all that is affirmed heere concerning this great ſeruant of God. And that any perſon either abſurdly incredulous, or prophanely blaſphemous, may ſee how little reaſon he hath in rebelling thus from the laws of human ſociety, and planting his owne either humorous imagination, or impious aſſertions in place thereof, I will addreſſe him to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Treatiſe, <hi>De vtilitate credendi,</hi> written by that Top and Crowne of wits <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> who by a number of most preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

reaſons, and moſt palpable experiments, doth demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrate it to be a point of ſottiſh pride and impertinency, and not of wit or iudgment for men to be euer questioning or doubting, &amp; to admit of nothing which hath paſſed vnder the teſtimony of their owne eyes.</p>
            <p>We therefore that are Catholikes ſhall make no difficulty, to imbrace with a moſt pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection the beliefe of this hiſtory, and Proteſtants I hope will find no true cauſe to doubt thereof. And moreouer if it were but euen out of nouelty, theſe later, me thinkes, ought to flye vpon this kind of ſtuddy, with great appetite, for as much as concernes the vnderſtanding part; becauſe in their owne Communion, they haue in effect none at all of whome they write, and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the liues of Saints: nay I ſcarce know of any ancient Saints whom yet they will (though extremely againſt the very appearance of common ſenſe) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to haue beene of their Religion, whoſe liues they haue written, or in whoſe honour they haue ſo much as publiſhed any Sermon, which yet they might do, at leaſt for admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or imitation, though they will not do it for Inuocation.

            <p>It is euident that Catholikes neuer let it paſſe their thoughts, that the life of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, or Libertine, was to be accompted a kind of madnes, according to the ſtate of this only world, and the diſcourſe of fleſh and bloud, (wherof that place of Scripture ſpeaketh:) for if we ſquare things by this only rule, and that we thinke not of the other better life, there is noe queſtion but they are the only wiſe &amp; well iudging men; and in conformity of this doth the holy Apoſtle expreſſe himſelfe, when he ſayth, that ſinnes are <hi>Prudentia carnis,</hi> The wiſedome of the fleſh.

               <p>So great was the delight ſhe tooke in prayer, as that the halfe houre which was aſſigned to that effect by her ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father,<note place="margin">Note.</note> did often paſſe a whole one. When ſometymes ſhe was alone, rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her ſelfe into the moſt ſecret parts of the houſe, ſhe gaue liberty vnto her ſoule to diſcharge thoſe amorous deſires which were kindled in it towards the obteyning of heauen.

               <p>BESIDES this, ſhe was ſo deſirous to receaue our Lord Ieſus being veyled vnder the ſhew of bread, that when ſhe ſaw her mother, or other deuout perſons communicate, ſhe procured to come cloſe to them, and being extremely in appetite to receaue the odour of that moſt ſacred food, ſhe could hardly part from ſuch as ſhe knew had receaued it. Afterward, being entred into the tenth yeare of her age, ſhe began (with the leaue of her Ghoſtly father) to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſometymes, and ſhe receaued ſo much delight therby, as forced from her the teares of ioy. And on the other ſide, ſhe did ſo afflict her ſelfe, when by any occaſion ſhe was hindred, that in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhe could find comfort.

of the ſoueraigne loue which our Lord Ieſus ſhewed, in leauing himſelfe vnto vs in the Bleſſed Sacrament &amp; no leſſe attentiuely conſidering what ſhe might render by way of gratitude for ſo great loue, ſhe did with admirable deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dedicate her ſelfe to Chriſt Ieſus by a vow of Virginity, when ſhe was arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but to the eleuenth yeare of her age. By that tyme ſhe delighted in nothing, but diſcourſing of heauenly things, nor did ſhe looke after any other obiect, but how ſhe might be wholy anſwerable to the example of her heauenly Spouſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore did ſhe refuſe ſoft beds,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and ſlept often vpon ſtraw, and in the moſt ſecret places of the houſe, ſhe wold be diſciplining of her ſelfe.

And becauſe where the diuine loue hath dominion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1661:40"/>
there is euer kindled a deſire of doing pennance more and more, therefore did this deuout child exerciſe her ſelfe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of mortification, as ſometims in her meate, not taking any more then what was meerely neceſſary, and ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſometymes, in making her ſelfe obedient to the vnworthieſt and baſeſt perſon in the houſe, and in many other holy actions altogeather repugnant to <hi>Senſe,</hi> ſeeking euer new meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe might become more acceptable to our ſoueraigne Lord.</p>

Neuertheles, there wanted not in that tyme, ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to diſturbe ſo great a frequence of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but ſhe kindling her ſelfe more and more in ſo holy a deſire, did not at all releaſe the ardent purpoſe ſhe had to get ground in the ſeruice of God.</p>

Thoſe Reuerend Mothers were moued by her vertue, to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary deſire, that ſhe would take their habit, and with particuler inſtance aduiſed her to it, letting her ſee the good which thereby would redound to the Monaſtery. Whereupon ſhe earneſtly prayed the illuminatour of all harts, to make her chooſe that place, which ſhould be moſt for the ſeruice &amp; honour of his diuine Maieſty.</p>
               <p>In the meane tyme, her Father &amp; Mother being returned from <hi>Cortona,</hi> tooke her home into the houſe, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare not by many wayes to diſturbe her holy purpoſe, being vrged by the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

Her parents hearing this, remitted all to her Ghoſtly Father, who wiſely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayled her to chooſe ſome Monaſtery, where both deuotion, and a perfect ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruant life did flouriſh in the Religious, to which her ſelfe was much inclined.

               <p>Hauing diligently then conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſeuerall Orders of Religion, ſhe was wholy ſatisfyed that this was the place to which our Lord had called her.

But finally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more and more moued by Almighty God to take the habit of Religion, on the Saturday precedent to the firſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day of Aduent, in the yeare 1582. ſhe entred into the Monaſtery to conſecrate her ſelfe for euer to the ſeruice of God.

                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> it is a wonder to tell, how ſhe felt interiourly ſo great an vnion with our Lord Ieſus, and ſuch a ſpirituall ſweetnes, that in all her life, as ſhe ſayd, ſhe remembred not to haue found the like.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to graunt her holy ſuite: whereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon being confirmed vnder the care of the Miſtreſſe, it cannot be expreſt with how much ſpirit ſhe gaue her ſelfe to the contemplation of heauenly Miſteryes. And if in the firſt yeare of her <hi>Nouiciate</hi> ſhe had made particuler proofe of her ſanctity, ſhe grew in doing of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not imploying her forces vpon any other thing, then the procuring of thoſe graces which make ſoules accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the eyes of God. She went euer thinking how ſhe might inflame others towards diuine loue, exhorting her Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to performe the ſeruice of God with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1661:48"/>
humility, and purity of mind. From her mouth there came none but holy words. She would excuſe the defects of others,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and interprete euery thing to a good end. She would neuer ſpeake much, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſhe were vrged by queſtions, &amp; that which ſhe ſayd, would be full of mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and charity.</p>
               <p>In this meane tyme, being yet more kindled to holy actions, ſhe was often rapt in ſpirit; and was come to ſuch a degree of perfection, that no worldly thing could diſorder the vnion which ſhe had with the diuine Maieſty. When it pleaſed God to reſtore her to her ſenſes ſhe would immediatly returne to her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Nouices,</hi> and ſhe proceeded towards them with ſo great humility and ſuaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it ſeemed not to be ſhe, who ſo lately had beene ſeene to participate of ſo high and heauenly Miſteryes, as one who valued not much ſuch gifts as thoſe, but attended only to ſolid vertue and the contempt of her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now her <hi>Superiour</hi> obſeruing the wonders that God wrought by meanes
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1661:48"/>
of this his true ſeruant (ſince euery day after the holy Communion they had ſeene her in exceſſe of mind, rayſed vp to the vnderſtanding of ſo high things) they appointed her, in vertue of holy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, to preuent the looſing of ſo great heauenly treaſures, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating whatſoeuer God ſhould manifeſt vnto her, with the Reuerend Mother <hi>Suor Vangeliſta del Giocundo</hi> her Miſtreſſe and <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena Mori.</hi> Of theſe two Mothers, the firſt who is yet liuing a Religious woman of great prudence &amp; of no leſſe vertue and ſanctity of life, hath witneſſed in particuler by oaths, and writings vnder her hand, that ſhe hath with her owne eyes ſeene that which is recounted in this Story of <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena,</hi> beſides many other Religious, who in like manner haue affirmed, and do affirme the very ſame.</p>
               <p>So as now <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena</hi> did relate to the ſayd Mothers the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and intelligences which were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1661:49"/>
deſired to maintaine her ſelf abiect &amp; vile in the ſight of others, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſhe alwayes preferred holy <hi>Obedience</hi> before any inclination of her own; and the rather ſhe did it in this caſe, to be the better aſſured thereby, whether or no there were any mixture of diabolicall fraud; but in this point ſhe was ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her Ghoſtly Father. And for the better teſtifying of the truth, the Right Reuerend Man <hi>Franceſco Benuenuti</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour and Confeſſarius of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, &amp; <hi>Penitentiarius</hi> of the <hi>Cathedrall Church</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> ſubſcribed with his owne hand to foure bookes written by the Religious, which conteine many deuout and high intelligences. By him they were deliuered to be reuiewed by the Fathers of the Society of Ieſus, who gaue this teſtimony, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be found in them, contrary to the Catholique fayth; but on the other ſide many things of perfection, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be vnderſtood by all, to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more in loue with God.</p>

Whereupon ſhe ſayd thus; <hi>O how ſweet and pleaſant is that place, but great are the workes which they muſt performe who aſpire thither. But if this were ſufficient, o my God, for the helping of thy creatures, I would liue a thouſand yeares in this manner, and ſhould hold my ſelfe to be glorious thereby. Thy Word made me aske to do ſome pennance for thy creatures: art thou content with this? then is it wellcome. Thou art Mighty, o my God, yet if thou hadſt not called me, and caſt me downe to the ground, I had not anſwered thee; but thy will be euer done, and I rather deſire to dye, then to offend the high Purity.

               <p>After this, ſhe remained a while in ſilence; but then in her owne perſon all reſigned to the will of God, ſhe ſayd: <hi>Non moriar, ſed adimplebo opera tua:</hi> I will not dye, but I will performe thy workes:

vpon which wordes ſhe returned from the Rapt. She conſidered then with her ſelfe, that which the Eternal Father had commanded;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and finding that ſhe could not otherwiſe lead that ſingular manner of life appointed by God, ſhe reſolued inſtantly to informe her Superiours of the whole affaire. Which ſhe did with ſingular humility; &amp; ſhe was anſwered by them (out of the great feare they had leaſt in this there might be ſome mixtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the Diuells craft) that ſhe ſhould performe Obedience vnto them; and as for her food, ſhe ſhould vſe no other, but ſuch as was common to all the reſt; and that they would not permit any one to be particuler in her manner of life. Nor did they this without mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but determined among themſelues to attend the iſſue, as knowing well, that if it were the will of our Lord, it would be more cleerely and apparant to them. And indeed it proued as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, for the day following, the houre of dinner being arriued; &amp; there being ſet before this ſeruant of God, ſuch diet
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1661:54"/>
as was prepared for the other Siſters, ſhe being commanded by holy Obedience (which vertue ſhe had euer in particuler recommendation beyond the reſt) wold needs begin to eate thereof, but it was not poſſible for her to ſwallow a bit; for all that which ſhe chewed and procured to put downe, was inſtantly and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly caſt out by vomite. Many and many tymes did the Superiours trye her, but neuer would there ſucceed other effect. Whereupon the Ghoſtly Father of the houſe, with Mother Prioreſſe, gaue her full liberty to lead that life which the ſupreme God impoſed vpon her, for now they knew that ſuch was his will; and that the craft or deceit of the Diuell had no part therein. So as vpon the day of <hi>S. Zanobius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Florence</hi> on the 25. of May in the yeare 1585. ſhe began in the name of our Lord, to eat bread &amp; drink water, only excepting on Sundays when ſhe was to feed vpon the meats of Lent, as our Lord had commanded her. And although ſhe felt great repugnance thus to lead a particuler life againſt the

                  <hi>When afterwards I went to ſpeake with that creature</hi> (this was vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her going to the Grate to ſpeake with one of her Aunts, and was there <hi>Rapt</hi> in <hi>Extaſis) I accuſe my ſelfe to haue committed a great hypocriſy, occaſioning my ſelfe to be thought for ſuch a one as I am not. Although I made a ſigne vnto thy creatures, but I deſerued not that they ſhould vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me, ſince I ſeemed to keep my ſoule vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and yet thou knowest how often I haue wandred from thee. I ſeemed to be a true Religious woman, and yet thou knoweſt the poore creature that I am: I demand mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, O my God, for this great hypocriſy, and I offer to thee thyn owne bloud, which was ſhed for me with ſo great loue: if thou ſend me to hell, O my Lord as I deſerue, thou mayſt iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly place me below Iudas, ſince I haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee ſo much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then I went to reſtore my body with neceſſary food, but what intention had I ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1661:66"/>
to honour thee? For I remembred not to offer vnto thee ſo many poore creatures, why perhaps had beene long knocking at gates for a bit of bread, which yet peraduenture was not giuen them. And for me miſerable wretched creature, without any labour of myne, and which is more without any merit, prouiſion is made by the Religion, whereby my body may be ſuſteyned. And not only did I commit this offence, but that other alſo in making that ſpouſe of thyne ſpeake ſo many words, and yet I knew that in that place it was not lawfull to ſpeake at all. Behould, O my Lord, how in all my operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s I find that I haue offended thee: how then ſhall I appeare in thy preſence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand gifts and graces of thee, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thy creatures to thee, I who haue ſo much offended thee, that I deſerue no mercy for my ſelfe? But that loue which moued thee to come down on earth, and to ſhed thy blood, let that moue thee to ſhew mercy towards my ſoule.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>When afterwardes I forbare to go to prayſe thee togeather with the reſt of thy Spouſes, it was only through myn own fault: for when that creature wiſhed me not to go, I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1661:66"/>
did instantly conſent to the not going. O my Ieſus if ſhe had required ſome act of Charity at my hands, I ſhould not ſo ſoone haue giuen conſent, O my Lord, how can I hope euer to come in place where I may eternally prayſe thee togeather with thoſe bleſſed ſpirits, ſince I haue fayled to prayſe thee togeather with thy ſpouſes heere? I offer thee thy bloud that by reaſon thereof thou mayſt haue mercy on me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And in that worke which I did, what intention had I to honour thee, O my Lord, when I grieued more for the tyme, which thou euen in taking from me doeſt giue, then I did for hauing fayled to offer my ſoule to thee</hi> (heere ſhe meaneth that tyme when our Lord did keep her alienated from her ſenſes.) <hi>I was carefull to giue a ſigne to thy little virgins for the keeping of ſilence, but I conſidered not how much more I was bound to keep my ſoule vnited to thee.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>When afterwards I was to haue inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the holy Ghost, I wandred with my mind ſo far off from thee, that I could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the manner which I was to hould therin, ſo as they who haue beene a leſſe tyme in a

               <p>ABOVE all the <hi>Extaſies</hi> of this belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Spouſe of Ieſus, that one was admirable which ſhe had vpon the <hi>Vigil</hi> of the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> in the yeare 1585. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe remayned eight continuall dayes from the ſayd <hi>Vigil,</hi> vntill the feaſt of the Bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> returning only to her ſenſes for the ſpace of two houres euery day, wherin ſhe recyted her office, and prouided for the neceſſity of her life, by feeding only vpon a little bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and taking very little reſt.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1661:68"/>
ſhe became ſo ioyfull and bright, and did ſpeake ſo ſublimely of the moſt hidden Myſteries, that it was a thing miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. And yet further, whileſt ſhe was ſpeaking in the perſon of the <hi>Eternall Father,</hi> or of Chriſt, or of her ſelfe, her voyce would be changed in ſuch ſort, that euen without vnderſtanding the wordes, one might haue knowne, that they were diuers perſons which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed by her tongue. So many were the ſpirituall intelligences, which our Lord communicated vnto her in this <hi>Rapt,</hi> as that being ſet downe by the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,</hi> as ſhe produced them, they make a iuſt volume, whereof is compiled an addition to the third part of her life. But to giue ſome patterne of the aforeſayd <hi>Extaſis,</hi> I ſay, that on the <hi>Vigil</hi> of the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> which came that yeare vpon the eight of Iune, ſhe was called by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father in theſe words.</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1661:69"/>
And hauing beene a while in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation ſhe began thus to ſpeake in the perſon of the <hi>Incarnate Word. Before thou enter into the admirable knowledge of my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, I will make knowne to thee what I meane to do with thee, therfore be attentiue.</hi> Heere ſhe ſtayed a while, and then reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the diſcourſe ſtill in the perſon of the <hi>Eternall Word. Know that vntill the day where you there below, do celebrate that feast, whereon thou didst ſo intrinſecally knit thy ſelfe to me, and I in ſo great aboundance gaue my ſelfe to thee</hi> (which was meant of the <hi>Profeſsion,</hi> which the yeare before ſhe had made vpon the day of the moſt holy <hi>Trinity) thou ſhalt be vnited to me in ſuch ſort that thou ſhalt be made partaker of diuin treaſures. Yet further know, that for the ſpace of fiue yeares (as heertofore I told thee) I will depriue thee of the feeling of my grace, but not of my grace it ſelfe, for that shall euer be in thee. That priuation ſhallbe made for the glory of my Father, for the ioy of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, and of all the bleſſed ſpirits which ſtand aſsiſting at the Throne of the moſt holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the example of mortall creatures, for
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1661:69"/>
the greater torment of damned ſoules, for the confuſion of Diuells, for the eaſe of the ſoules in Purgatory, and for the comfort of thy ſelf. I will alſo proceed with thee like to a valerous Captaine, who before he exalt his ſouldier to high honour, doth put him to many proofs; and ſo I, before I will exalt thee in the ſight of my Father, will proue thee firſt. Thou ſhalt therfore indeauour to haue in thee the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thy being nothing, and to be euer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding, and executing the internall inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I will giue thee, as hitherto thou hast done. But although thou haſt heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done it with much indeauour, yet heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after thou must do it with much more. Thou ſhalt procure to obſerue, nay I command thee that thou do obſerue interiourly, withall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, all the directions, which I haue giuen thee. Thou ſhalt reproue the defects of others ſpeaking euer all truth. I tell thee yet further that in all the</hi> Feria's Sexta's <hi>(if thou wilt be attentiue at the houre when I dyed vpon the Croſſe) thou ſhalt receaue the ſpirit which I rendred to my eternall Father; and although thou feele it not, yet ſhall it euer deſcend on thee.

               <p>To this ſhe anſwered cheerfully, <hi>ſufficit mihi gratia tua.</hi> And after hauing beene a while in ſilence, the diſcourſe of the <hi>Incarnate Word</hi> followed on with great earneſtnes, and aboundance of ſpeach to this effect, <hi>There will not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

ſuch as I haue appointed to fauour thee</hi> (this was ſayd by her Patron-Saints) <hi>in bringing to thee ſpirituall food, and thou ſhalt ſpeedily flye vnder the ſhaddow of my purity, not making any motion, or operation without that, although yet euen this ſhallbe without the feeling of my grace.

Thou ſhalt take in the firſt aſſault my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: In the ſecond my hart and thyne: In the third my woundes, which thou hast of me: In the fourth the crowne of thorns which I wore: In the fifth the great deſire which thou haſt of the ſaluation of my creatures. And if all the Diuells in hell come with great fury to fright thee, thou ſhalt not yet be afrayd: for as their Enuy hath no end, ſo I will neuer be wanting to continue my grace in thee. And faile not thou to relate that, which thou ſhalt participate therein.</hi> This was meant by the high Intelligences which he would be pleaſed to graunt her, as afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>

O my God, who is blind in himſelfe, true in ſpeaking of thee, and of thy creatures?

               <p>After theſe, and many ſuch other intercourſes of heauenly ſpeach, which as hath beene ſayd are noted in a booke apart, ſhe added this in the perſon of the only begotten Word. <hi>Feare nothing my deereſt Child, for I will euer remayne with thee, and this probation which I am pleaſed to make of thee, ſhallbe an euident ſigne of the certainty of the great gifts and graces which I haue graunted thee.

And as ſhe had receaued from her moſt gracious God thoſe ſingular gifts which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuered in the ſecond part, that is, <hi>The ſacred woundes in her ſoule; the crowne of thornes; the being eſpouſed by Ieſus; his hart;</hi> and <hi>the participation of his diuine pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> ſo on the other ſide ſhe vnderſtood that ſhe was to be aſſaulted by fiue moſt grieuous tentations.

Fourthly ſhe was to fall into ſo great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of mind, that ſhe might haue run into many acts of deſperation, if ſhe had not beene moſt vigilantly carefull. And laſtly the inordinate appetite, and deſire of meates was extremely to aſſault her, with other tentations, which were to be in a manner infinite.</p>
               <p>Heereupon ſhe ſayd often after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, that there remayned not as it were any tentation, which ſhe had not proued; and by the exceſſiue furiouſnes thereof, ſhe ſuffered griefe almoſt inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable.

               <p>BY how much more victorious ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned after theſe infernal battails, ſo much the more did the Diuel torment her, with new temptations.

But when the tentation was diminiſhed ſo many were her teares, her ſighes, and ſo great her ſadnes, that euery one would haue thought ſhe had committed ſome grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne. Beſides, ſhe was incredibly tempted in Fayth, and the Diuell ſought to perſwade her,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that ſhe ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the B. <hi>Sacrament,</hi> &amp; that God was not there. Nay many tyms ſhe found ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty to receaue it; for draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere to the little window to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, ſhe remayned as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all ſenſe; and to her ſeeming, the Diuell would ſtand there, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to kill her. Beſides, he caſt it into her thought, as if there were no other life but this; and therefore there was no cauſe, why ſhe ſhould labour and indure ſo much. Sometyms ſhe came to ſo great aridity of ſpirit, that ſhe was ſcarce able to looke vpon the ſacred Images, and pictures. Oftentimes the Diuel tempted her to blaſpheme God, and the Saints;
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1661:89"/>
and chiefly, when with the reſt of her Siſters, ſhe was ſinging the diuine Office in the Quire, at that time ſhe heard ſuch blaſphemyes pronounced in her eares, and ſuch horrible outcryes of Diuells, that (ſeeming to her by great odds to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the voyces of her Siſters) ſhe had much difficulty to comply with her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligations. Whereupon, weeping often for grief in great aboundance, ſhe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to her Siſters, ſaying, <hi>Pray to Ieſus for me, that in ſteed of praying him, I blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him not;</hi> and the Religious were moued to much compaſſion by ſeeing this bleſſed ſoule ſo afflicted in the ſpirit of deuotion. For this reaſon, the Ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father was often forced to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate her alone, that more eaſily ſhe might ouercome thoſe tentations. But hardly was ſhe fortifyed ſufficiently euen by that heauenly food, for the tentations would occure againe with greater fury; the Diuell indeauouring to perſwade her, that ſhe had loſt the diuine grace, and therefore that the cuſtome of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating did her no good, but rather
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1661:89"/>
that the Iuſtice of God was prouoked ſo much the more to her puniſhment. And thus ſhe became byond all conceit full of dolour, &amp; only thought how ſhe might carry her ſelfe in thoſe fierce aſſaults. In the midſt of theſe cogitations, it came once into her mind, to vſe a remedy which againſt tentations ſhe had learned of the <hi>B.

               <p>But ſoone after, the temptations began againe to aſſault &amp; vrge her with ſuch fury, that oftentimes the <hi>Prioreſſe</hi> commanding her to do ſome things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der holy <hi>Obedience,</hi> ſhe was euen as it were conſtreyned to refuſe the doing of it in wordes, although her mind were

               <p>It happened in particuler manner, vpon the day of the holy <hi>Annunciata</hi> in the ſame yeare, that being rapt in ſpirit, ſhe ſpake for the ſpace of ſix houres, of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> in ſo high manner, that whoſoeuer had heard her, would haue beene aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p>Beſides this ſhe ſaw, when ſhe was in Extaſis, at ſeuerall tymes, the glory of many Saints in heauen, wherby ſhe was

did but tend to the increaſe of her tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo as the Phiſitians allowed her but a ſhort tyme of life; the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſayd ſicknes was ſuch, as that by little and little it did eate away all her fleſh. Many tymes ſhe had recommended her ſelfe to the prayers of <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena,</hi> but ſhe one day in the yeare 1589. going to viſit this ſicke perſon, was ſo inflamed with Charity, as that with her tongue ſhe began to licke her handes and armes, in thoſe places where the peſtiferous euill did moſt afflict her, and hauing told the ſicke perſon, that ſhe muſt haue confidence in God,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and in the B. <hi>Virgin,</hi> becauſe ſhe ſhould be cured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſhe went.

               <p>At the ſame time, there was in the Monaſtery a lay Siſter called <hi>Suor Pace Colombini.</hi> This woman had loſt all ſenſe in one whole ſide of her body, through the exceſſiue torment that ſhe had felt;

So much the more, becauſe for her greater mortification, ſhe imployed her ſelfe as hath been ſayd already, in thoſe painefull exerciſes, of drawing water, and doing of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things; and neither making any account of the raine or ſnow, ſhe went vp and down, ſometymes in the garden, and ſometyms in other places of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery; ſo that through the moſt bitter ſeaſon of the yeare, her fleſh would break and open in ſuch ſort, as to ſhed bloud in great quantity; and that would make moſt painefull ſores.

Moreouer the vſuall tyme of feeding or ſleeping ſhe did ordinarily ſpend in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prayer, or in exceſſes of mind. And yet euen when ſhe would diſpoſe her ſelfe to take any reſt, ſhe ſlept in her cloathes, and almo t euer vpon a hard ſacke of ſtraw, or els vpon the bare ground. Her ſleep was extremly ſhort; for that mind, which was accuſtomed in thoſe Nocturnal houres to transforme it ſelfe often into God, by diuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, could hardly induce it ſelfe to giue long repoſe to the body, though it were much weakned with affliction. And yet more to exerciſe her ſelf in wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching (not only in the tyme of her <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> but euen in the whole courſe of her life, whileſt ſhe had any health) ſhe obtayned that the Office ſhould be euer hers, of calling the Religious to <hi>Mattins.</hi> Many tymes alſo in the very dead of the night, ſhe was heard to ſigh and weep
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1661:122"/>
bitterly, and ſometimes to puniſh her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with ſharp and ſeuere diſciplines, but ſhe being aſſiſted by diuine grace found her ſelfe in the midſt of theſe mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to gather ſtrength.</p>
               <p>When the fiue yeares of her <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> were ended, ſhe had particuler light from our Lord, how his diuine will was, that ſhe ſhould, according to the cuſtom of the Monaſtery, returne to the vſe of ſingle ſoaled ſhooes and ſlippers, which ſhe did readily fullfill, but as for hoſe, in her life ſhe neuer put any on againe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for a time of two yeares, wherein ſhe was ſtill recouering out of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſicknes. After her <hi>Probation</hi> ended, ſhe began alſo (being ſo aduiſed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue) to take vpon Sundayes, not the food of Lent, but ſuch as was common to the Monaſtery; and on thurſdayes to drinke a litle wine, but vpon other dayes ſhe continued to faſt with bread and water, for twenty months afterwardes. But her Superiours then ſeeing that her forscedayly diminiſhed by her leading ſo rigorous a life, and fearing that ſo they

Wherupon they ordeyned, that ſhe ſhould feed vpon commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meats, wherin after her manner ſhe obeyed readily. And verily ſhe was in this an admirable ſpectacle to all the Monaſtery; for ſtill ſhe fed her ſelfe moſt ſparingly, and choſe for her food the meaneſt &amp; pooreſt meats,<note place="margin">Note.</note> making ſhew with a holy kind of craft that ſhe liked them beſt.</p>
               <p>But ſhe neuer gaue ouer the vſe of cloathing her ſelfe with one only Coat, and that the pooreſt in the Monaſtery, except in the two yeares of her great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and recouery from the ſame; nor did ſhe euer giue ouer to ſleep vpon a
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1661:123"/>
hard ſacke of ſtraw in the whole tyme of her life.

And heerein did euidently appeare the diuine prouidence, for that body of hers came by little and little to ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme extenuation, that without faile ſhe could not haue long e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dured either vpon a ſacke, or yet vpon a mattreſſe. So as in this manner this good Mother came by ſo prayſe-worthy a life vnto her death, &amp; thereby ſhe being top full of merits, and of holy operations paſſed on as we may piouſly beleeue, to life eternall.</p>

ſhe was inflamed towardes the deſire thereof, that praying in ſome retyred places of the Monaſtery, ſhe would hold in her hand a great candle, from which the drops of burning waxe might fall, and for the loue of God ſhe would ſuffer them to pierce her naked armes and legs in ſuch ſort, as that afterwards ſhe could hardly go; and this cuſtome ſhe followed both many tymes, and during much tyme.

and when at any tyme the ſicknes grew great, the good Mother would ſometims by holding them vp in her armes, and ſometimes feeding them, performe all the good offices which are imaginable. Among many others this one deſerues to be remembred.</p>
               <p>There was a lay Siſter, who had long been ſicke, and hauing a veyne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in her breaſt, was afflicted with much infirmity, and griefe. <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena</hi> hauing obſerued this, tooke her into her care, and continuing ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a yeare, the ſayd Siſter dyed.

               <p>ON the 22. of December in the yeare 1594. being in exceſſe of mind, ſhe ſaw the ſoule of a ſinner, who at that inſtant departed out of this life, and was condemned to thoſe euerlaſting paynes.

ought to hold the three vowes, by which Religious perſons were tyed to God, in that holy ſtate.

               <p>And indeed ſhe made ſuch account of the freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t receauing of the B Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that ſhe could not endure any one to depriue her ſelfe voluntarily thereof; and would ſay; <hi>Thou knoweſt not, O bleſſed child, of what thou haſt depriued thy ſelfe this morning: Knowest thou not, that there is not a more effectuall meanes towards the getting of true perfection then this B.

               </head>
               <p>IT was a ſtrang and curious accident that chanced in the yeare 1599. when <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena</hi> was Miſtres of the Nouices. It happened, that one of her Nouices was called to the grate to ſpeak with a brother of hers, who led not any of the beſt liues. And ſo hauing giuen her leaue to ſpeake with him, ſhe alſo as Superiour went in her company, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of the Monaſtery. Being both come to the grate, the yong gentlemen had ſcarce ſaluted his Siſter, when inſtantly he went away in a fury, without vſing any further ſpeach, or ſo much as taking his leaue. The Nouice wondered, and grieued, to ſee the ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty vnciuil departure of her brother, but her owne Mother ſhortly after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to viſite her, ſhe asked her ſayd Mother, whether he had yet acquainted
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1661:160"/>
her therewith: to which ſhe anſwered, that his departure grew, from his not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to remain in the preſence of the Religious woman who was in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;<note place="margin">Note.</note> and that ſhe hauing caſt an eye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him, he found himſelfe inſtantly and interiourly to be filled with ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion &amp; ſhame, as that (being ſurprized with an extraordinary inquietude) he was not able to remaine in her preſence, but was forced to take himſelfe out of ſight. From that time forwards he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his courſe of life, and hath ever ſince giuen good example to others</p>
               <p>And ſurely this <hi>Suor Maria Maddale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> had that vertue in her moſt pure aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect imparted by Almighty God; for in particuler thoſe Religious do teſtify who are now liuing, &amp; formerly were vnder her charge, that they ſhould eaſily paſſe ouer any affliction, &amp; be wholy appeaſed in their mind, by ſeeing in her eyes ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, as if it had been diuine; and on the other ſide, being admoniſhed or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by her, they would from her very countenance take reaſon euen of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

and vnſpeakable ſorrow for their faults. And becauſe with her only coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſhe penetrated the mindes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo far to the quike, and cleerely ſaw the ſtate wherein they were, when ſhe was called to the Grate, ſhe found that ſhe ſpake to ſome with great repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and to others with great conſolation, ſo that only by her aſpect indeed Angelical, one might come to the knowledg of her angelicall life.</p>

told interiourly, that if ſhe were placed in the others preſence, ſhe ſhould be freed of her paine. Therefore ſhe was brought by the Religious into the preſence of the deuout Mother being in Rapt, and the ſicke perſon being ſet vpon her knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, that ſide of her was toutcht where ſhe felt the paine, and preſently ſhe found her ſelfe deliuered thereof and free from the infirmity, whereof ſhe had no taſt in all the reſt of her life, which is teſtifyed by many of the Religious yet liuing.</p>

Now ſhe (vnſwathing the ſicke Arme) drew forth the tents, by which only act the paine ceaſed, and in ſhort tyme ſhe recouered her wonted health, to the wonder of thoſe Phiſitians who held her incure.

an admirable thing, that none of them could euen then go from her without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme contentment and ſatisfaction.<note place="margin">Note.</note> But her anguiſh more increaſing euery day, ſhe felt ſometimes in her breſt, as if it had beene a raſour, which would haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her parts one from another; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in her head, as if there had beene ſtrockes with hammers, and ſuch other vnſpeakable torments, that if formerly ſhe had not freely offered her ſelfe to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, or had not had a liuely notice of the nobility of ſuffering for the loue of Ieſus Chriſt, her ſo many ſeuerall anguiſhes, which were exceſſiue beyond humane conceit, would infallibly haue produced wordes of impatience.</p>

               <p>The Phiſitians could neuer find a reaſon, how that body might be able to keep it ſelfe in life ſo long, vnder the burthen of ſo many &amp; ſo cruell torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. Nay, and the Religious themſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all aſtoniſhed would ſay ſometymes, that it was impoſſible for her to liue 8. dayes. And yet thoſe dayes did paſſe, &amp; weekes, and moneths; ſo that all human diſcourſe was put to ſilence, and it grew to be accounted miraculous (that body of hers being then reduced to ſuch ſtate,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1661:175"/>
that hardly the Religious had the hart to viſit her, as not being able to endure ſo lamentable a ſpectacle.) And euen when they did viſite her, they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their tears; they had not the power to looke vpon her; they loſt as it were the vſe of ſpeach ſo as then they parted from her very often without ſpeaking any word vnto her at all.</p>
               <p>The Father who then had the care of the Monaſtery, &amp; communicated her euery morning, did often ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her, extremely fearing that ſhe had not force to ſwallow downe that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall food, as alſo he doubted leaſt that act of piety, in the bitternes of her pains, might depriue her of life. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, ſhe tooke hart by tymes, &amp; would needs euery day heare the ſacred Office, to which ſhe would often liſten with incredible attention, whileſt two of her Siſters were reciting it neere her bed; and ſometymes ſhe would alſo her ſelfe pronounce ſome verſes. Finally, after fiue months of ſo great infirmity, ſhe was exhorted by the Phiſitians to take
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1661:176"/>
the <hi>Extreme Vnction,</hi> eſteeming that at the moſt ſhe could not paſſe two or three dayes of life. She (as foreknowing her approaching death) did inſtantly reſigne and prepare her ſelfe with great humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the taking of that holy Sacrament. But firſt ſhe did with ardent wordes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Monaſtery to the Father, who was the Gouernour thereof, and made him a promiſe, <hi>that if ſhe went to heauen, ſhe would pray earnestly to God both for him and all the Religious, that after this ſhort life they might meet in that celestiall kingdom.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> She then deſired the Prioreſſe to draw all the Religious thither into her preſence; and <hi>ſhe asked pardon of them all for her defects, and for the euill example that ſhe had giuen them, encouraging them to keep themſelues true ſpouſes of Christ Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, ſhe receaued of the Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly Father on the 13. of <hi>May</hi> in the year 1607. the <hi>Extreme Vnction,</hi> and ſhe her ſelfe did anſwere both to the verſes, and to the <hi>Letanies,</hi> and neuer remoued her eye from a Crucifixe, which ſhe would needs hold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in her hand. There
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1661:176"/>
were not then heard other then ſighes and ſobbes of the Religious, who all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſtrate about the bed of their deer Mother, made as it were a very poole of tears. As ſoone as ſhe had receaued this Sacrament, by the comfort which ſhe drew from thence, ſhe was all cleere in countenance, and ſeemed in a manner as if all her paines had left her. And turning towards the <hi>Confeſſarius</hi> ſhe ſayd; <hi>Father I vnderſtand that to morrow morning you will go to viſit thoſe Fathers the Eremits of Monte Senario,</hi>

               <p>At midnight, the Father returned to her with the <hi>Viaticum,</hi> and (which till then had neuer happened) he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated her in the preſence of all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious. This being done, ſhe was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1661:178"/>
to reioyce exceedingly, and through the great ſpirituall contentment of her ſoule, to receaue ſtrength euen in her body; but by this tyme, the houre of her parting out of this tranſitory life drew neere vpon her, and of her aſpiring to that Crowne which once being gotten is neuer loſt. Therefore the Fathers was called to her at<note n="*" place="margin">That is about 8. or 9. by our accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> twelue of the clocke in the morning, that he might be preſent at her death, as was much deſired by her.

But the Ghoſtly Father, being yet to ſay Maſſe, &amp; to communicate the Religious, he departed thence; and whileſt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared himſelfe, he was aduertiſed how that holy Soule was euen then going to God; ſo that he was much perplexed with the doubt of what he were beſt to do, becauſe if he went to the dying Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſhould not be able (it being then too late) either to ſay maſſe, or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Religious.</p>
               <p>But by the prouidence of God it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:1661:179"/>
came into his mind, to ſend her word, that in vertue of holy <hi>Obedience,</hi> ſhe ſhold reſpite her dying ſo long, as that he might haue ended Maſſe, and miniſtred the moſt holy <hi>Sacrament</hi> to the Religious. It is an admirable thing, how when ſhe receaued that meſſage, ſhe ſeemed to be all reuiued, &amp; ſtrengthned, yea and not hauing ſpoken at all for many hours, ſhe then ſayd inſtantly with a cleare and cheerefull voyce,<note place="margin">Note.</note> being accompanyed with a gracious ſmile; <hi>Benedictus Deus.</hi> And hauing demanded ſomwhat which might giue her ſtrength, ſhe turned to her Siſters who there were preſent, ſaying; <hi>I giue thankes vnto our Lord, that euen to the very laſt he hath left me ſo deſolate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſpirit.</note> 
                  <hi>and without comfort.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1661:179"/>
Pſalmes and Hymnes, to the end that her holy ſoule might in the midſt of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Laudes (which by her were ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly loued) be receaued into that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall Countrey.</p>
               <p>At 18. houres of the clocke vpon Friday, &amp; expreſly at that houre where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord was tormented vpon the Croſſe with the greateſt pains, ſhe alſo vpon the Croſſe of her bitter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, although with extreme ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp; almoſt no motion at all, finiſhed happily her life on 25. of May, in the yeare 1607. that being the feaſt day of S. <hi>Zanobius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Florence.</hi> Her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance remayned ſo faire and white, that inſteed of giuing offence, it did of all ſides breath forth deuotion, &amp; the odour of ſanctity. And that holy ſoule, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pureſt done, being euery way enuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with glorious light, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by ſquadrons of Angels, did flye as becommeth vs to beleeue, into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of God, to liue happily there for all eternity.

               <p>O bleſſed ſoule, now that thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt triumphant in that happy countrey of Charity, in that kingdome of loue, imploy I beſeech thee thy feruent prayers to the great God, for the children of thy Monaſtery. Thou didſt vndergo many labours for them, thou didſt beare paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full burthens, that thou mightſt with excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertue diſcouer to them the way of true happines. And if thy zeale were ſo great in this miſerable and fading life, now that thou art aſcended vp to heauen and art inflamed with more ardent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, how much greater muſt thy heat be in that moſt glorious kingdome, which was heere ſo great in the company of terrene and humane paſſions. No other thing is aſpired by them, but to feele by experience the force of thy deere and bleſſed help, by giuing help with thy prayers, towardes thoſe vertues which conduct the poſſeſſours of them to that crowne, of which there is difficulty in

getting, but no danger in looſing. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not that any tyme the horrible infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Serpent, with the poyſon of diſcord may diſturbe their holy purpoſes; nor diminiſh their <hi>Obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> which is both the Mother and the Nurſe of peace. Procure that theſe thy ſiſters who are conſecrated to the ſeruice of God, may be zealous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to humane poſſibility towardes true Religious obſeruance, and that they may haue no other ayme but to execute thoſe <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Counſells</hi> tending to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which they haue receaued from their Superiours.

               <p>I will not now expreſſe my ſelfe to thee in many wordes, to intreate thy prayers to the eternall God for me, who yet find my ſelfe in this valley of teares; for I confide in that which thou didſt ſo often promiſe me, with carefull charity, whileſt I miniſtred to thee the moſt holy <hi>Sacraments,</hi> in thy laſt ſicknes.

               <p>THE Religious therefore ſeeing in their preſence their deere Mother depriued of life, it cannot be expreſt, what cordial ſighes of affection they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from their harts, towardes the bleſſed body, and in what aboundance they did euen raine tears from their eyes. On the one ſide ſtood the Nouices, on the other the yong Religious, who had beene gouerned by her, and thoſe others alſo who had beene vnder her care in the Office of <hi>Subprioreſſe.</hi> Then all the other Mothers togeather, did compaſſe in the holy Corpes, making pious and deuout contemplations. And in that dolorous ſpectacle, there were heard ſo piteous ſighes, and ſo ardent ſobbes, that no one could hold from tears. Neither did they faile to do ſo alſo in the Chapter-houſe,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1661:182"/>
whither ſhe was brought vpon the Beare after they had performed the vſual ſacred ceremonyes, to recite deuout Hymnes, and Pſalmes. The place whereon ſhe lay was couered with ſtore of flowers, &amp; ſhe in the midſt therof; dead I confeſſe, but with a face ſo Angelical, as that it ſeemed after a ſort, that the glory of her ſoule did euen ſhine in ſome degree through her body. At two hours before Sunne ſet, at thoſe grates of the Church, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vpon the <hi>Chapter-houſe,</hi> there was made by the Father, who hath the charge of them, a ſpirituall diſcourſe to all the Religious, in honour of the ſeruant of God, exalting thoſe holy vertues wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by on earth ſhe had purchaſed a Crown in Heauen.</p>
               <p>On the morning following, the holy body was placed in the Church, of whoſe death when the voyce was a little ſpread throughout the Citty, ſuch a multitude of people came in that it was a wonder. The people in a holy manner were ſtriuing among themſelues, now in taking with deuotion of thoſe flowers,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1661:182"/>
which vpon the <hi>Bleſſed Corpes</hi> were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, now in kiſſing the habit wherwith it was clad, now in touching the hearſe, and now calling <hi>Suor Maria Maddalena</hi> a <hi>Bleſſed woman,</hi> and a <hi>Saint;</hi> nor knew they how to departe thence, but would enioy, as long as it was poſſible, the ſight of that diuine countenance. And (to ſatisfy the pious affection of the people) by tymes, it was neceſſary to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the hearſe againe (and that aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly) with flowers, that euery one might depart contented.</p>
               <p>Some were alſo placed for the guard of the <hi>Bleſſed Body,</hi> it being doubted leaſt the people ſhould deuide ſome part of it from the reſt. And for the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, there was difficulty to performe the <hi>ſacred Office.</hi> The Church was open from the 15. houre of the ſame morning with free liberty for euery one to ſee the <hi>B. Mother,</hi> but fearing there would be ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>motion, it was ſhut afterwards, &amp; ſo the doores were beaten with blows and our eares by the earneſt prayers of ſuch as deſired to ſee her. Therfore there
